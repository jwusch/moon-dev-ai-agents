    {
      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): groq: GME is a meme stock with high retail interest, similar to NOK.

    {
      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with similar volatility profile to WULF. Follows BTC mining profitability cycles. Strong retail interest in crypto infrastructure plays. Recent sector rotation creates reversion opportunities.; claude_opus: CleanSpark is a Bitcoin miner with added ESG narrative appeal. Shows WULF-like volatility patterns with sharp reversals. Mining stocks tend to overshoot both directions vs Bitcoin itself, creating frequent mean reversion opportunities.

      "symbol": "TSLA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: Tesla (TSLA) offers high volatility and boom/bust cycles in the EV sector, with meme stock potential from retail fandom similar to NOK, and strong trends/reversals like SOL-USD. Sector rotation in autos/tech amplifies moves, plus indirect commodity exposure via batteries. Recent price weakness (down ~20% from April 2024 highs on delivery misses) positions it for mean reversion with robotaxi hype or China recovery. Matches multiple goldmine patterns in volatility, meme, and rotation; high beta to Nasdaq supports quick reversals.; ollama_gpt: Tesla is a high\u2011volatility growth stock that undergoes boom/bust cycles tied to earnings, regulatory news, and macro sentiment.

      "symbol": "UNG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Like EQT, UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund) is directly tied to natural gas prices, experiencing commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility. Natural gas prices can be highly seasonal and subject to unexpected weather events, leading to sharp price swings. Recent price weakness due to warmer-than-expected weather or increased supply could provide a mean-reversion opportunity.; xai: United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) tracks natural gas futures, similar to EQT's commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility, with boom/bust patterns from supply disruptions and seasonal demand. High volatility enables sector rotation in energy commodities. Recent price weakness (down ~15% in Q2 2024 from mild weather) could reverse with hurricane season or export growth, fitting mean reversion strategies. Matches goldmine commodity exposure and cycles; low inventories suggest high-confidence rebound potential."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: PLTR exhibits high volatility due to its association with AI and government contracts. It experiences boom/bust cycles driven by investor sentiment regarding its growth prospects and contract wins. Recent concerns about valuation and competition have led to price weakness, making it a potential mean-reversion candidate if positive news emerges regarding its technology or contract pipeline.; xai: Palantir (PLTR) has meme-like retail interest and high volatility from AI/software hype, echoing NOK's potential with boom/bust cycles in tech sector rotations. Sharp trends and reversals similar to SOL-USD, driven by contract wins. Recent weakness (down ~15% post-earnings volatility in 2024) could reverse on government AI spending. Fits goldmine volatility and meme patterns; cult following and high short interest (~10%) make it a mean reversion candidate with momentum indicators turning positive."

Shows periodic 100%+ rallies followed by sharp declines. Currently consolidating near multi-year support levels.
