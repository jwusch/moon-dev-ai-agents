Significant price swings make it a mean reversion candidate. Parallels EQT's reliance on commodity cycles and weather patterns.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, echoing EQT's commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility. It experiences high volatility from supply disruptions, seasonal demand, and energy sector rotations, with boom/bust patterns tied to global events.

It sees sector rotations during risk-off periods and sharp reversals from mining supply news.

It exhibits volatility from sector rotations into legacy tech and boom/bust cycles around earnings or acquisition rumors. Recent weakness from broader tech sell-offs and competition has it trading at multi-year lows, ripe for mean reversion if positive catalysts emerge.

It undergoes boom/bust cycles independent of fundamentals, with high short interest amplifying moves.
