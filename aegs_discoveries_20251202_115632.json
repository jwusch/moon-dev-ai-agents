      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with similar volatility profile to WULF and MARA. Highly leveraged to Bitcoin price movements with pronounced reversals. Recent institutional interest and meme stock following among retail traders.; xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) is another crypto mining stock with extreme volatility tied to Bitcoin cycles, akin to MARA and WULF. It has shown boom/bust patterns with rapid gains during crypto rallies and steep declines in bear markets, plus sector rotation in energy/tech hybrids. Recent weakness from 2024 crypto dips (down ~30% YTD as of mid-2024) suggests mean reversion potential as mining efficiency improves and Bitcoin stabilizes. Matches goldmine patterns: crypto mining, high volatility, commodity/crypto exposure. Ideal for mean reversion as it deviates below its 200-day moving average, historically reversing in bull cycles."

Matches 'EQT' pattern.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, aligning with EQT's commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and sector rotation in energy. It exhibits boom/bust patterns from supply disruptions and demand shifts. Recent weakness (down ~15% in 2024 amid mild weather) positions it for mean reversion as winter heating demand historically reverses trends. Matches goldmine patterns: commodity exposure, high volatility, boom/bust cycles. Excellent mean reversion play with seasonal patterns showing 20-50% swings around means."

Recent price weakness (down ~20% in Q2 2024 amid BTC pullback) positions it for mean reversion, as it often outperforms BTC in recoveries.
