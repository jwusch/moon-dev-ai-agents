    {
      "symbol": "TSLA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: EV leader with a history of sharp swings tied to production milestones and sentiment shifts. The stock has cyclical upside/downside tied to macro\u2011interest rates and EV adoption curves, and it\u2019s been in a recent corrective phase after a prolonged rally.; ollama_llama: High volatility, boom/bust cycles due to electric vehicle and renewable energy trends. Meme stock potential with strong retail interest."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "SLV",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: SLV (iShares Silver Trust ETF) provides commodity exposure to silver, with volatility from industrial demand and safe-haven flows, mirroring EQT's cycles but with added boom/bust from mining supply issues. It features sector rotation in precious metals and recent weakness amid 2024 gold outperformance. This positions it for mean reversion if inflation persists or tech demand (e.g., solar) surges, akin to the weather/commodity volatility in EQT.; ollama_llama: Commodity cycles, sector rotation opportunities in the silver market, and recent price weakness due to interest rate expectations."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "HUT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: HUT (Hut 8 Mining) is a crypto mining firm like WULF and MARA, with high volatility from Bitcoin halvings and energy costs, boom/bust cycles, and strong trends with reversals similar to SOL-USD. It has commodity ties via power resources. Recent 2024 price weakness post-halving profitability concerns sets up mean reversion as hash rates stabilize and crypto rebounds, offering rotation into mining sector plays.; claude_haiku: Crypto mining with weather-driven operational costs (cooling, energy). Combines EQT commodity volatility with MARA mining dynamics. Sharp reversals on BTC sentiment shifts."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "PLUG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: Hydrogen fuel cell stock combining commodity exposure (hydrogen production costs), meme stock retail interest, and clean energy sector rotation. Boom/bust cycles tied to energy policy.; claude_opus: Plug Power shows extreme boom/bust cycles in clean energy sector. High retail interest creates meme-like behavior. Sector rotation between growth and value creates volatility. Currently in weakness phase after 2021 highs, potential reversion candidate. Matches volatility and retail interest patterns."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: Also a meme stock, similar to GME and NOK.  Experiences high volatility from retail trading frenzies and short covering.  The company's financial struggles amplify boom/bust cycles. Recent price declines provide a bounce opportunity. Matches 'Meme stock potential, telecom, high retail interest' pattern.; xai: AMC Entertainment is a classic meme stock with high retail interest akin to NOK, featuring extreme volatility, boom/bust cycles from social media hype, and sector rotation in entertainment/consumer discretionary. It has shown sharp reversals and price weakness since early 2024 peaks due to debt concerns, making it a strong mean reversion candidate if retail sentiment reignites, mirroring the meme-driven rallies in the provided goldmine examples."
