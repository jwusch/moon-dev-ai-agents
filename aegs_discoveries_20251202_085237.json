    {
      "symbol": "RBLX",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: High retail interest and meme stock potential, akin to NOK. Significant growth stock with volatile price swings dependent on user growth and engagement metrics. Recent underperformance due to slowing growth could lead to a mean reversion bounce.; ollama_llama: Gaming industry leader with meme stock potential, recent price weakness due to sector rotation, and high retail interest."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_opus: Palantir exhibits meme stock characteristics with high retail interest like NOK. Tech sector rotation creates volatility. Strong trends with sharp reversals during sentiment shifts. Government contract cycles add boom/bust element.; ollama_llama: Cloud software stock with high growth expectations, sector rotation potential, and volatility matching EQT's commodity cycle exposure."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "XOM",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Large integrated oil and gas company. While more stable than individual natural gas producers, it still experiences volatility related to commodity prices and geopolitical events. Recent pullbacks after oil price surges could offer a mean reversion opportunity. Sector rotation out of energy could be overdone.; ollama_gpt: Exxon is a classic commodity play with weather\u2011driven volatility and sector\u2011rotation dynamics. Oil prices dipped recently, causing a 10\u201115% pullback. Given the cyclical nature of energy and strong fundamentals, a mean\u2011reversion trade is plausible."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NIO",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: NIO is a high\u2011growth EV play that has experienced pronounced boom/bust cycles and a recent decline after a rally. Its sector rotation appeal (EVs vs traditional automakers) and strong retail interest make it a good mean\u2011reversion candidate. The recent 15\u201120% dip provides a potential reversal point.; ollama_llama: Chinese electric vehicle leader with meme stock potential, volatility matching SOL-USD, and sector rotation opportunities."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another meme stock with similar characteristics to GME and NOK. High short interest and retail participation contribute to volatility. Struggles with debt and changing entertainment landscape create opportunities for short squeezes and subsequent mean reversion.; xai: AMC (AMC Entertainment) is a classic meme stock with NOK-like high retail interest, extreme volatility from short squeezes, and boom/bust cycles tied to movie industry recoveries. It offers sector rotation in entertainment/leisure and indirect commodity exposure via debt tied to oil (fuel costs). Recent price weakness from 2023 highs due to streaming competition and dilution has it trading near lows with high put/call ratios, making it a prime mean reversion candidate as meme stocks often revert sharply on hype cycles; aligns with goldmine volatility and reversal patterns."
