      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_opus: Palantir exhibits meme stock characteristics with passionate retail base, high short interest periods, and sentiment-driven swings. Government contract news creates binary events. Matches NOK pattern of tech stock with retail interest that overshoots on both fear and greed, ideal for mean reversion.; deepseek: Meme stock with high retail interest and volatile earnings cycles (NOK pattern). Recent weakness after AI hype cycle peaked, but maintains strong government contracts creating floor. Extreme sentiment swings between 'next big AI play' and 'overvalued hype stock' create mean reversion opportunities."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NVDA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: AI/semiconductor play with meme stock characteristics and crypto mining GPU demand. Extreme volatility with sector rotation sensitivity. Recent weakness in crypto/AI cycles creates mean reversion setups despite large cap status.; ollama_gpt: NVIDIA is a leading semiconductor that experiences frequent sector\u2011rotation flows and high volatility around earnings and product launches.  The stock recently dipped 9% after a 2023 rally, trading near its 200\u2011day SMA.  This offers a mean\u2011reversion opportunity and aligns with the high\u2011volatility + sector\u2011rotation pattern."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "XOM",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: Exxon Mobil, major oil and gas company.  While not as volatile as crypto or meme stocks, it experiences commodity-driven cycles similar to EQT.  Subject to geopolitical events and supply/demand shifts.  Often exhibits mean reversion behavior after significant price swings due to these factors.; ollama_gpt: Exxon Mobil is an oil commodity play that is highly weather\u2011driven and volatile.  After a 10% drop following a spike in oil prices, XOM trades above its 20\u2011day SMA, offering a potential mean\u2011reversion trade.  This aligns with the commodity + volatility pattern of the goldmine list."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "CLF",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_llama: CLF is a mining stock with exposure to iron ore and other commodities, exhibiting boom/bust cycles. Its recent price weakness could reverse as commodity trends improve.; deepseek: Steel commodity play with cyclical volatility (EQT pattern for industrial metals). Tied to auto/construction cycles and China demand. Currently weak on recession fears, but strong balance sheet provides floor. Mean reversion potential when manufacturing data surprises positively."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): ollama_llama: Meme stock potential and high retail interest, like NOK, with a recent price drop that could trigger a reversal due to its entertainment industry exposure.; openrouter_gemini: Classic meme stock mirroring NOK. High retail interest, prone to volatile swings based on social media sentiment. Fundamentals are weak, creating opportunity for boom/bust cycles and subsequent mean reversion bounces."
