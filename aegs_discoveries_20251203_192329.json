      "symbol": "HUT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): groq: HUT is a Bitcoin mining stock with exposure to crypto cycles, similar to MARA. High volatility and recent price weakness present a potential mean reversion opportunity.; xai: Mirrors WULF and MARA in crypto mining operations, with high volatility driven by Bitcoin cycles and energy costs. It shares boom/bust patterns from crypto exposure, including sharp trends and reversals akin to SOL-USD.

Recent weakness amid higher electricity costs and crypto pullback positions it for mean reversion with efficient mining upgrades and potential rotation into green energy-themed stocks.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining with boom/bust cycle characteristics identical to WULF. Highly correlated with crypto market sentiment. Extreme intraday volatility and sharp reversals during market regime changes. Recent deleveraging creates mean reversion opportunities."
