      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another Bitcoin mining stock, directly correlated with Bitcoin price movements, mirroring MARA.  Experiences boom/bust cycles alongside the crypto market.  Significant price decline during recent crypto corrections presents a mean reversion opportunity. Confidence: High; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a crypto mining stock, directly matching WULF and MARA's characteristics of high volatility, boom/bust cycles tied to Bitcoin prices, and following crypto market cycles. It has experienced sharp reversals similar to SOL-USD, with recent price weakness after a 2024 peak due to crypto pullbacks, positioning it for mean reversion as mining profitability rebounds with potential BTC halving aftereffects and institutional interest. High retail exposure adds meme-like fervor during upswings."

      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: A quintessential meme stock, heavily influenced by retail sentiment and short squeezes. Its price action is often disconnected from fundamentals, creating opportunities for mean reversion strategies when it deviates significantly from its average price. Confidence: Medium; xai: GME (GameStop) exemplifies meme stock potential like NOK, with high retail interest driving erratic volatility and boom/bust cycles from social media hype. It has commodity-like exposure through e-commerce rotations but shines in sector shifts to retail/entertainment.
