      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (7 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin mining stock, RIOT follows crypto cycles and exhibits high volatility, similar to MARA. Recent price weakness due to crypto market downturn could reverse as crypto trends upward.; openrouter_gemini: Similar to MARA, RIOT is a Bitcoin mining stock heavily correlated with Bitcoin's price. It experiences boom/bust cycles mirroring crypto volatility, making it a strong mean reversion candidate after pullbacks. It matches the 'MARA' and 'WULF' goldmine patterns."

    {
      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: GameStop (GME) is the original meme stock. It has extreme volatility, driven by retail sentiment and short squeezes. While the long-term outlook is uncertain, short-term mean reversion trades can be profitable if timed correctly. This matches the 'NOK' goldmine pattern.; xai: GME (GameStop) embodies meme stock potential like NOK, with high retail interest driving erratic volatility and boom/bust cycles detached from fundamentals. It features sector rotation opportunities in retail/consumer goods during hype phases. After a post-2021 fade, recent weakness (down 20% in the last quarter amid broader market rotation) suggests mean reversion potential if social media buzz reignites, similar to NOK's telecom meme surges, capitalizing on oversold conditions for a short-term reversal."

    {
      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with boom/bust cycle characteristics similar to WULF. Leveraged to Bitcoin price action. Experiences sharp reversals and trend changes. Retail interest comparable to meme stocks. Currently depressed valuations relative to historical peaks.; xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) is another crypto mining play, directly comparable to WULF and MARA's high volatility, Bitcoin-tied cycles, and boom/bust extremes. It benefits from sustainable mining trends for sector rotation appeal. Recent price drop (over 60% from 2024 highs amid energy costs and BTC correction) positions it for mean reversion, as efficiency improvements and crypto rebounds could spark a reversal, with strong retail interest adding meme-like volatility."

      "symbol": "TSLA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): ollama_llama: Meme stock potential with high retail interest, driving sharp price swings. Commodity exposure through electric vehicle demand and production. Price has recently weakened, creating a mean reversion opportunity.; xai: TSLA (Tesla) combines high volatility from EV sector rotation, meme stock potential via Elon Musk-driven retail interest, and boom/bust cycles like SOL-USD's trends. It has indirect commodity exposure through battery metals. After recent weakness (down 20% on margin pressures and competition), it's set for mean reversion as AI/robotics narratives rotate back in, with historical patterns of sharp reversals from oversold levels mirroring NOK's retail hype dynamics."

      "symbol": "UNG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: UNG is an ETF that tracks the price of natural gas futures. Like EQT, its price is subject to commodity cycles and weather-related volatility. Sharp price swings can present mean reversion opportunities, particularly during seasonal changes. This matches the 'EQT' goldmine pattern.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, matching EQT's commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and boom/bust patterns in energy. It offers sector rotation opportunities as investors shift to commodities during inflation or supply disruptions.

Its recent underperformance could be a buying opportunity for a potential mean reversion, especially if silver prices rise.; xai: SLV (iShares Silver Trust ETF) tracks silver prices, offering commodity exposure with high volatility and boom/bust cycles influenced by industrial demand and safe-haven flows, akin to EQT's weather-driven swings but tied to metals. Sector rotation into precious metals during uncertainty enhances its appeal. With recent weakness (down 10% on rate hike fears), it's a mean reversion candidate as silver often reverses sharply on supply deficits or inflation hedges, matching goldmine commodity patterns."
