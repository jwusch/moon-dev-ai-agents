Recent price drops due to milder weather present a mean reversion setup.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund) is an ETF tracking natural gas prices, directly akin to EQT's commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and boom/bust patterns influenced by seasonal demand and supply disruptions. It offers sector rotation opportunities in energy during winter heating seasons.
