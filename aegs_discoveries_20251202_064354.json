    {
      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): ollama_llama: Meme stock potential, high retail interest, and recent price weakness make it a good candidate for mean reversion trading.; openrouter_gemini: Similar to AMC, GME is a well-known meme stock with high volatility tied to retail trading frenzies and short squeezes.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) operates in Bitcoin mining with a focus on sustainable energy, akin to WULF and MARA's high-volatility crypto cycles and commodity-like exposure to energy costs. It shows boom/bust behavior driven by Bitcoin price trends, with strong retail interest amplifying meme-like pumps. After underperforming in Q2 2024 due to energy price spikes, it displays recent weakness below key support levels, making it a prime mean reversion candidate as crypto sentiment rotates back and mining stocks catch up to Bitcoin's recovery.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with high beta to Bitcoin. Strong meme stock potential among retail traders. Experiences extreme volatility with weather-dependent operations (cooling costs). Currently depressed from peaks offers mean reversion opportunity."

It exhibits sharp trends and reversals akin to SOL-USD. Following 2024 delivery misses and competition pressures causing a pullback from highs, TSLA's recent weakness below its 50-day average makes it a strong mean reversion play, especially with upcoming robotaxi events potentially catalyzing a rebound."
