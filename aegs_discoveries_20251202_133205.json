      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining with high beta to BTC. Follows crypto boom/bust cycles identically to WULF. Smaller cap creates volatility amplification. Weather-dependent operations (cooling costs) add commodity-cycle seasonality. Institutional underweight vs retail interest.; claude_opus: CleanSpark is another Bitcoin miner with high operational leverage to crypto prices. Smaller market cap than RIOT/MARA means even higher volatility on crypto swings. Recent expansion efforts create additional catalysts. Matches the WULF/MARA crypto mining pattern with boom/bust cycles driven by Bitcoin halving events and price movements."

      "symbol": "RIG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: Transocean (RIG) operates in offshore oil drilling, matching EQT's commodity cycles with weather and demand-driven volatility, plus boom/bust patterns tied to oil prices. It has high volatility from energy sector rotations and exposure to global commodity trends. Following OPEC cuts and a mid-2024 dip due to rig utilization slowdowns, RIG exhibits recent price weakness but is poised for mean reversion as oil demand rebounds seasonally, with historical sharp reversals during energy upcycles.; claude_opus: Transocean provides leveraged exposure to offshore drilling and oil prices. Extreme boom/bust cycles with high beta to energy sentiment. Debt structure amplifies equity moves creating volatility. Matches commodity cycle pattern with additional financial leverage creating mean reversion opportunities on sentiment shifts."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining exposure with Canadian listing creating currency volatility overlay. Extreme volatility during crypto cycles. Lower institutional coverage than US-listed miners increases retail-driven meme potential. Sector rotation plays strongly into mining stocks.; ollama_llama: Crypto exposure and potential for high volatility, similar to SOL-USD; recent decline may be due to short-term market conditions rather than long-term fundamentals."

Recent regulatory concerns and market downturn have created potential for a mean reversion bounce. Matches SOL-USD and WULF goldmine patterns.; xai: Coinbase Global (COIN) provides direct cryptocurrency exchange exposure, echoing SOL-USD's extreme volatility and trend reversals while acting as a broader crypto sector play similar to MARA's Bitcoin proxy role. It experiences boom/bust cycles with high retail interest and sector rotation opportunities in fintech/crypto. Following a post-ETF approval pullback and regulatory headwinds in mid-2024, COIN has shown recent price weakness, but its fundamentals in trading volume suggest mean reversion potential as crypto adoption rebounds and meme-driven hype returns."
