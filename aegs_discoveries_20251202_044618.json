It has demonstrated strong trends followed by sharp reversals, much like SOL-USD.

Commodity exposure via energy-intensive mining adds to its cyclical nature.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with extreme volatility correlated to BTC price action. Strong meme stock following among retail traders. Weather-dependent operations (cooling/energy costs) add commodity-like cycle exposure."
