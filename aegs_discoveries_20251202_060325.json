      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): groq: GME is a meme stock with high retail interest and recent price weakness, similar to NOK. Its volatility and potential for sector rotation make it a good candidate for mean reversion.; openrouter_gemini: Another meme stock with similar characteristics to AMC and NOK. Prone to short squeezes and retail-driven rallies. High volatility and unpredictable price action make it a mean reversion candidate.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) focuses on sustainable Bitcoin mining, similar to WULF and MARA, with boom/bust cycles driven by crypto market trends and energy costs. High volatility from operational expansions and halvings, plus commodity exposure via electricity dependencies. Recent weakness (down ~30% in Q3 2024 amid broader crypto pullback) suggests mean reversion potential as mining efficiency improves and Bitcoin stabilizes above $60K. Aligns with goldmine crypto volatility and cycles; sector rotation opportunity as clean energy narrative rotates back in.; claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with direct crypto cycle exposure. Follows MARA/WULF patterns with high volatility, boom/bust cycles tied to BTC price action. Recent weakness from $20+ highs creates mean reversion setup. Retail interest in mining narrative."

Fits goldmine high retail interest and sharp reversals; sector rotation into tech/discretionary during ad recovery.; ollama_gpt: Roku\u2019s streaming platform is subject to cyclical advertising demand and retail hype. The share price has pulled back from a recent high, and its volatility profile makes it a candidate for mean\u2011reversion as ad\u2011revenue cycles normalize. Sector rotation into media/entertainment adds upside."

Matches WULF and MARA patterns.; xai: COIN (Coinbase Global) is a crypto exchange proxy like SOL-USD and MARA, with extreme volatility from trading volumes, regulatory news, and Bitcoin trends. Boom/bust cycles amplified by fee-based revenue. Recent price dip (~20% in Q3 2024 on SEC delays and market cooldown) positions it for mean reversion as crypto adoption grows via ETFs.
