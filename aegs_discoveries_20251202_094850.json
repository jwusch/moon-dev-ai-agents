It experiences extreme price swings tied to the Bitcoin/crypto cycle, mirroring the boom/bust dynamics of WULF and MARA. The recent dip following the crypto market correction has created a clear mean\u2011reversion window as miners typically rebound when hash rates and BTC prices recover.; xai: RIG (Transocean) is an offshore drilling stock with commodity exposure to oil, exhibiting high volatility, boom/bust cycles, and weather/geopolitical-driven swings similar to EQT's energy ties. Sector rotation in oil services amplifies moves. Recent price weakness from 2024 rig count slowdowns positions it for mean reversion as OPEC cuts and demand recovery catalyze uptrends.
