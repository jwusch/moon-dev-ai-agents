      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (7 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin mining stock, RIOT follows crypto cycles and exhibits high volatility, similar to MARA.

      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): groq: GME has meme stock potential, high retail interest, and has exhibited extreme volatility, similar to NOK. Recent price weakness could be followed by a sharp reversal as sentiment shifts and retail interest returns.; openrouter_gemini: The original meme stock.

      "symbol": "XOM",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: Large-cap oil and gas company exposed to commodity cycles, similar to EQT.  While less volatile than the others, significant drops due to economic slowdown concerns or ESG pressures can provide mean reversion opportunities. A sector rotation back into energy could also fuel a rebound.; ollama_gpt: Exxon Mobil is a large energy\u2011commodity play with weather\u2011driven volatility and strong sector\u2011rotation signals (oil demand, geopolitical events).

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: Fuel cell technology company with exposure to the renewable energy sector.  The sector is subject to policy changes and technology adoption rates, leading to boom/bust cycles. Similar to EQT in its sensitivity to external factors.  Recent underperformance increases mean reversion attractiveness.; deepseek: Clean energy/alternative fuel stock with extreme boom/bust cycles driven by policy changes and energy sector rotation.
