      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (7 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin mining stock, RIOT follows crypto cycles and exhibits high volatility, similar to MARA. Recent price weakness due to crypto market downturn could reverse with a potential crypto market uptrend.; openrouter_gemini: Similar to MARA, RIOT is a Bitcoin mining company. Its stock price heavily correlates with Bitcoin's price movements, making it subject to high volatility and boom/bust cycles. Recent dips mirroring Bitcoin's pullback present a mean reversion opportunity."

      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another meme stock akin to NOK and AMC, GME remains highly volatile due to retail trading frenzies. Despite its fundamentals, it experiences unpredictable price spikes and crashes. Recent price dips could be followed by a mean reversion rally, though the timing is unpredictable.; ollama_gpt: GameStop remains a meme\u2011stock archetype with extreme volatility and frequent reversals.  Its price is currently 15% below the 20\u2011day moving average after a brief rally, suggesting a mean\u2011reversion opportunity.  The stock\u2019s high retail attention matches the NOK pattern."

      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): xai: CleanSpark (CLSK) mirrors WULF and MARA as a Bitcoin mining company with extreme volatility tied to crypto boom/bust cycles. It shows meme stock potential due to retail investor hype around sustainable mining narratives, akin to NOK's telecom interest. After sharp declines in 2023 amid energy cost pressures, its recent weakness suggests mean reversion potential if crypto sentiment improves, aligning with commodity exposure and sector rotation into renewables.; claude_haiku: Crypto mining with similar volatility profile to WULF and MARA. Trades on sentiment swings and mining profitability cycles. Recent energy cost concerns and BTC pullbacks created oversold conditions ripe for reversal plays."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: Tesla\u2019s price swings are extreme and often driven by hype cycles, aligning with WULF\u2019s boom\u2011bust pattern.  After a recent 15% pullback from a 3\u2011month peak, the stock sits near its 20\u2011day moving average, offering a mean\u2011reversion opportunity.  The high retail participation also echoes the meme\u2011stock vibe.; ollama_llama: Sector rotation opportunities in the tech sector with recent price weakness, matching EQT's commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility."

    {
      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Technology company with considerable retail interest and a history of volatile price swings. While not a meme stock in the same vein as AMC or GME, it's prone to sentiment-driven rallies and sell-offs. It can experience sector rotation between growth and value stocks. Recent price weakness after earnings disappointment could lead to a mean reversion bounce as the market re-evaluates its long-term potential.; ollama_llama: Cryptocurrency exposure through crypto mining, following extreme volatility and strong trends. This matches the SOL-USD pattern."

      "symbol": "RIG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: Transocean (RIG) operates in offshore oil drilling, exhibiting commodity-driven volatility and boom/bust cycles similar to EQT's weather-influenced gas patterns, with exposure to oil price swings. It has meme-like retail interest during energy rallies. Recent weakness in 2024 from OPEC cuts and rig count declines makes it a mean reversion candidate if oil demand rebounds, supporting sector rotation into energy services.; deepseek: Offshore drilling stock with extreme commodity cycle volatility tied to oil prices.

      "symbol": "COIN",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: Cryptocurrency exchange, directly tied to crypto market volatility like SOL-USD and MARA.

It has sector rotation potential in metals/energy. Following weakness in late 2023 from China slowdowns, recent price dips suggest mean reversion as copper prices trend up, matching goldmine commodity exposure without direct crypto ties.; claude_haiku: Freeport-McMoRan: Copper mining with commodity cycle exposure. Highly volatile due to China economic data, inflation expectations, and industrial demand. Boom/bust cycles similar to EQT. Recent copper weakness creates mean reversion setup."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): ollama_gpt: BlackBerry\u2019s recent weakness (down ~25% from a 3\u2011month high) coupled with its meme\u2011stock potential and high retail interest makes it a strong mean\u2011reversion candidate.  It also shares the boom\u2011bust volatility seen in WULF and NOK.; claude_opus: Classic meme stock with NOK-like characteristics - legacy tech company with retail cult following. Periodically catches fire on WSB attention. Currently in prolonged weakness creating potential reversal setup. Cybersecurity pivot narrative provides catalyst potential."

      "symbol": "AR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_llama: AR is a natural gas stock with commodity cycle exposure, similar to EQT.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: A quintessential meme stock like NOK, AMC exhibits high retail interest and extreme volatility driven by social media sentiment. While fundamentally challenged, it's prone to sharp price swings, making it a suitable, albeit risky, mean reversion candidate. The recent negative news around debt and competition could present an overreaction.; ollama_gpt: AMC is a canonical meme stock with intense retail trading and frequent sharp reversals.  After a recent 20\u2011day pullback from a 3\u2011month high, the stock is poised for a mean\u2011reversion bounce.
