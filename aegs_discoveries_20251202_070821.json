      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another major Bitcoin mining stock, mirroring MARA's characteristics. Heavily influenced by Bitcoin price fluctuations and investor sentiment. Significant price declines during crypto bear markets create mean reversion opportunities. Matches 'Crypto mining, high volatility, boom/bust cycles' and 'Bitcoin proxy, mining stock, follows crypto cycles' patterns.; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a Bitcoin mining stock, directly matching the crypto mining and high volatility boom/bust cycles of WULF and MARA. It acts as a leveraged proxy to Bitcoin prices, experiencing extreme swings tied to crypto market sentiment. Recent price weakness following the broader crypto downturn in 2023-2024 positions it for mean reversion if Bitcoin rallies, as mining stocks often overshoot declines and snap back sharply during recovery phases. High retail interest adds meme-like potential during hype cycles."
