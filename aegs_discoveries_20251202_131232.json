      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with similar volatility profile to WULF. Experiences sharp reversals following mining profitability shifts. Meme stock potential among retail traders interested in crypto infrastructure. Weather-dependent operations (cooling costs) add commodity-like cycle exposure.; claude_opus: CleanSpark is another Bitcoin miner matching WULF/MARA patterns. Smaller market cap than RIOT creates even higher volatility. Recent expansion investments create leverage to BTC price moves. Mining stocks typically overshoot both directions vs underlying crypto."

      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another Bitcoin mining stock, mirroring MARA. Highly correlated with Bitcoin's price and volatility. Boom/bust cycles are pronounced.

It also has meme stock potential similar to MARA due to retail interest in crypto.; xai: RIOT Blockchain is a crypto mining stock similar to WULF and MARA, with high volatility tied to Bitcoin cycles and boom/bust patterns in the crypto sector. It exhibits extreme price swings driven by crypto market sentiment, making it ideal for mean reversion after recent weakness from broader crypto sell-offs (e.g., post-2024 halving corrections). Matches goldmine patterns of crypto exposure and mining volatility; recent 20-30% drawdown from peaks suggests potential reversal as mining profitability rebounds with BTC stabilization."

      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Similar to GME, AMC is a well-known meme stock with extreme volatility and high retail interest, aligning with NOK. Heavily shorted, making it prone to short squeezes. Its price action is often disconnected from fundamentals, making it suitable for mean reversion strategies. Downturns due to wider market sell-offs or company specific bad news create opportunities.; xai: AMC Entertainment embodies meme stock potential like NOK, with high retail interest driving sporadic squeezes and boom/bust cycles in the entertainment sector. Its volatility stems from social media hype and debt concerns, leading to sharp trends and reversals. After recent weakness (trading near multi-year lows in 2024 due to box office slumps), it could revert mean as meme rotations revive or streaming fatigue boosts theaters, aligning with high-volatility retail-driven patterns."

      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: The quintessential meme stock, capturing the essence of NOK. Extremely high volatility driven by retail sentiment. While its fundamental value is questioned, short squeezes and retail-driven rallies can create significant mean reversion opportunities. Recent sideways movement after a rally creates a potential entry point.; xai: GameStop (GME) is the archetype of meme stock volatility, similar to NOK's retail frenzy, with boom/bust cycles fueled by short squeezes and community interest. It shows strong trends with abrupt reversals, perfect for mean reversion trading. Recent price dips (post-2021 highs, consolidating lower in 2024) indicate weakness from e-commerce competition, but potential reversal via sector rotation into consumer discretionary or renewed meme hype."

Higher debt levels create amplified moves vs commodity prices. Weather sensitivity and LNG export demand shifts create frequent dislocation opportunities for mean reversion."
