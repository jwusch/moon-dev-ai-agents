      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) mirrors WULF and MARA as a Bitcoin mining company with high volatility driven by crypto exposure and energy costs. It follows boom/bust cycles in the mining sector, amplified by retail interest during crypto hype. After a sharp decline of over 40% in recent months amid broader market corrections, it shows potential for mean reversion as Bitcoin stabilizes and mining stocks historically overshoot to the downside before reverting to cycle averages, with commodity-like energy ties similar to EQT.; claude_haiku: Crypto mining with extreme volatility and correlation to BTC price action. Smaller cap than RIOT creates sharper reversals. Weather-dependent operations (cooling costs) add commodity cycle element like EQT."

      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (7 votes): openrouter_gemini: Similar to MARA, RIOT is a Bitcoin mining stock that closely follows crypto cycles.
