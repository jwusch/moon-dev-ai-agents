      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: High\u2011volatility EV stock with boom/bust cycles tied to production and sentiment. TSLA\u2019s 2\u2011month pullback of ~15% after a 5\u2011month rally, coupled with a weak macro backdrop, signals a mean\u2011reversion opportunity. TSLA is also a key driver in EV sector rotation.; ollama_llama: High volatility and boom/bust cycles due to electric vehicle demand, meme stock potential with strong retail interest. Recent price weakness after high growth expectations."

      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) mirrors WULF and MARA as a crypto mining play with extreme volatility from Bitcoin dependency and energy cost fluctuations. It follows boom/bust cycles in the crypto sector, similar to SOL-USD's sharp reversals, and has shown recent weakness amid broader market sell-offs in miners. Good for mean reversion due to undervaluation relative to hash rate growth; aligns with goldmine commodity/crypto exposure and high retail interest potential.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with extreme volatility comparable to WULF. Follows crypto boom/bust cycles with retail speculation interest. Weather-dependent operations (cooling costs) add commodity-like cycle characteristics similar to EQT."
