      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): openrouter_gemini: Bitcoin mining company, similar to MARA. Directly tied to the price of Bitcoin and crypto market cycles. High volatility due to the inherent risk of cryptocurrency. Recent price weakness, mirroring crypto downturns, presents a possible mean reversion scenario.; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a Bitcoin mining company, directly mirroring the crypto mining and high volatility boom/bust cycles of WULF and MARA. It acts as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy with extreme price swings tied to crypto market sentiment. Recent price weakness following the broader crypto downturn in 2023-2024 (down ~50% YTD) positions it for mean reversion as Bitcoin halvings and ETF inflows could spark a cycle reversal, similar to SOL-USD's sharp trends and reversals.
