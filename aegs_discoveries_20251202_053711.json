Its recent price weakness could reverse as crypto markets recover, making it a good mean reversion candidate.; openrouter_gemini: Functions as a Bitcoin mining proxy, mirroring MARA.

It matches the commodity cycles of the goldmine list, with potential for sharp reversals. Recent price weakness (down ~15% in 2024 amid mild weather and high storage) sets up mean reversion as winter demand looms, offering sector rotation plays in energy commodities during inflationary environments."
