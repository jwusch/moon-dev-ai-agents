Recent weakness from mild weather and oversupply in late 2024 sets up mean reversion potential as winter demand or geopolitical events trigger sector rotation into energy commodities.; deepseek: Natural gas ETF with weather-driven volatility similar to EQT. Contango issues create persistent mean reversion opportunities in futures curve.
