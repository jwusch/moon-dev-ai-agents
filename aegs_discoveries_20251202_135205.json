      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) mirrors WULF and MARA as a crypto mining play with high volatility and sensitivity to Bitcoin's boom/bust cycles. It has shown strong trends followed by sharp pullbacks, akin to SOL-USD. After recent dips due to energy cost pressures and market sentiment, it could revert to means as renewable energy narratives rotate back in, attracting retail interest in undervalued miners.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with similar leverage to Bitcoin price movements as MARA. Highly volatile with sector rotation sensitivity. Benefits from retail interest during crypto rallies and faces sharp reversals during downturns."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Offshore drilling company, highly correlated to oil prices (a commodity). Experiences boom/bust cycles based on energy demand and supply. Significant volatility due to geopolitical factors and energy market dynamics. Recent weakness in oil prices could make it a mean reversion target.  Similar to EQT in terms of commodity exposure and cyclicality.; claude_opus: Transocean exhibits extreme boom/bust cycles tied to oil services.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, directly matching EQT's commodity cycles, weather volatility, and high boom/bust swings from supply disruptions. Like WULF's crypto ties, it's sensitive to energy trends. After recent price drops from mild weather and high storage, it could mean revert with winter demand spikes or rotation to energy commodities.; claude_opus: Natural gas ETF provides direct commodity exposure matching EQT's weather-driven volatility. Contango/backwardation creates additional mean reversion opportunities. Currently near multi-year lows with seasonal demand catalysts approaching. Pure commodity cycle play."

Similar to RIOT/MARA but with slightly lower correlation to US market sentiment, creating independent mean reversion opportunities.; claude_opus: Bitfarms is a smaller Bitcoin miner with amplified crypto cycle exposure.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Cryptocurrency exchange, sensitive to crypto market cycles like SOL-USD and MARA.

It exhibits extreme price swings driven by Bitcoin's trends, much like SOL-USD's sharp reversals. Recent price weakness from crypto market corrections positions it for mean reversion as mining profitability rebounds with potential halving cycles or ETF inflows, offering sector rotation from tech to crypto proxies.; claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with direct crypto cycle exposure. Exhibits extreme volatility correlated with BTC price action, similar to MARA and WULF. Strong boom/bust cycles tied to mining profitability and difficulty adjustments.

It benefits from sector rotation in metals amid green energy demands. Recent weakness from China slowdowns and oversupply suggests mean reversion as infrastructure spending rotates back, boosting industrial metals."

After recent price erosion from broader crypto weakness, it could mean revert strongly if Bitcoin stabilizes, drawing institutional rotation into BTC-adjacent equities.; deepseek: Bitcoin proxy through corporate treasury strategy, exhibits even higher beta to BTC than miners. Massive volatility with crypto cycles, currently depressed but positioned for explosive recovery if Bitcoin rallies. Combines crypto exposure with corporate structure for unique volatility profile."
