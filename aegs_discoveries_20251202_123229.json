Also, has potential for meme stock surges.; xai: Coinbase Global (COIN) provides direct crypto exposure as a trading platform, sharing the extreme volatility and trend reversals of SOL-USD and mining proxies like MARA. It benefits from crypto boom/bust cycles and has meme potential during market euphoria. After a 2024 pullback tied to regulatory fears and Bitcoin dips, mean reversion is likely as trading volumes pick up in sector rotations toward digital assets."

It follows Bitcoin's price trends with extreme swings, offering sector rotation in the crypto/energy intersection.

Recent weakness may present a mean reversion opportunity, though high risk.; xai: AMC Entertainment embodies meme stock potential like NOK, with massive retail-driven volatility and boom/bust cycles fueled by social media. It has commodity-like exposure through entertainment sector rotations during economic recoveries. After prolonged weakness from 2023-2024 amid streaming competition, recent squeezes indicate mean reversion setup, especially if retail interest reignites in a risk-on environment."

Experiences extreme price swings independent of fundamentals.  Sharp recent declines could lead to a short-term mean reversion bounce, but extremely risky.; xai: GameStop (GME) is the archetype of meme stocks with extreme volatility and sharp reversals akin to NOK and SOL-USD. High retail interest drives unpredictable trends, with sector rotation in consumer discretionary. Exhibiting recent price weakness post-2024 hype fade, its history of explosive rebounds positions it well for mean reversion trading on oversold bounces."
