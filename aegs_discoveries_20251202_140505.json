      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: Similar to MARA, it's a Bitcoin mining stock heavily influenced by crypto cycles. High volatility due to Bitcoin price fluctuations and operational risks. Often experiences sharp price swings, making it suitable for mean reversion strategies. Catches the crypto exposure of WULF and MARA.; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a crypto mining stock, directly matching WULF and MARA's patterns of high volatility, boom/bust cycles tied to Bitcoin prices, and following crypto market cycles. It has experienced extreme price swings with sharp reversals similar to SOL-USD. Recent price weakness due to broader crypto downturn post-2024 halving provides a mean reversion opportunity, as mining stocks often rebound strongly when Bitcoin recovers from oversold conditions; high retail interest adds meme-like potential."

After a recent 12\u2011week decline, TSLA sits near a 50\u2011day moving average, suggesting a mean\u2011reversion setup.

High volatility due to evolving technology and market sentiment toward clean energy. Recent price drops create a potential mean reversion setup. Some meme stock potential.; deepseek: Clean energy/fuel cell company with extreme boom/bust cycles driven by policy changes and energy sector rotation. Similar to EQT's commodity/energy volatility pattern but in alternative energy space. Currently depressed after hydrogen hype cycle faded, positioned for mean reversion on next green energy policy catalyst."

Likely to experience boom bust cycles.; xai: AMC (AMC Entertainment) embodies meme stock potential with high retail interest and volatility like NOK, featuring boom/bust cycles driven by social media hype and short squeezes. It has commodity-like exposure via entertainment sector rotations during economic recoveries. After prolonged weakness from post-pandemic theater slumps, recent dilution fears create a mean reversion setup if retail fervor reignites or box office rebounds."

      "symbol": "UNG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: United States Natural Gas Fund. Similar to EQT, it's tied to natural gas prices, which are highly volatile and influenced by weather patterns, supply/demand imbalances, and geopolitical events. Experiences commodity cycles, making it suitable for mean reversion strategies. Recent price weakness due to lower natural gas prices.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, directly echoing EQT's commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and high boom/bust potential. It provides pure exposure without company-specific risks, ideal for sector rotation in energy.

It offers sector rotation potential as LNG exports grow. High volatility from supply disruptions matches the goldmine traits. Recent price weakness due to mild weather and oversupply creates a mean reversion candidate, especially if winter demand spikes reverse the downtrend.; claude_opus: Antero Resources is a natural gas producer matching EQT's commodity cycle exposure. Weather-driven volatility and seasonal patterns create predictable mean reversion setups. Currently in sector rotation as nat gas prices stabilize after volatility. Similar fundamental drivers to EQT goldmine."

Recent price weakness amid China slowdowns and inventory builds makes it a strong mean reversion play on economic recovery signals or supply constraints.; claude_haiku: Copper mining with commodity cycle volatility matching EQT characteristics.

It shows strong trends with reversals like SOL-USD and has emerging meme potential from retail crypto enthusiasts. After recent weakness from expansion costs and BTC consolidation, mean reversion is likely as mining profitability rebounds with lower energy prices or halving effects.; claude_opus: Bitfarms is Canadian Bitcoin miner with same crypto cycle exposure as MARA/WULF. Smaller market cap creates higher volatility and sharper reversals matching SOL-USD patterns. Recent operational improvements not yet priced in. Strong mean reversion candidate on crypto sentiment shifts."
