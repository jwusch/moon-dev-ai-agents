      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (7 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin mining stock, RIOT follows crypto cycles and exhibits high volatility, similar to MARA. Recent price weakness due to crypto market downturn could reverse as the market recovers, making it a potential mean reversion candidate.; openrouter_gemini: Bitcoin mining company, heavily correlated with Bitcoin price movements and overall crypto market sentiment, like MARA. Exhibits high volatility and boom/bust cycles. Recent underperformance compared to Bitcoin provides a mean reversion opportunity. Matches 'Crypto mining, high volatility, boom/bust cycles' and 'Bitcoin proxy, mining stock, follows crypto cycles' patterns."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: Palantir is a tech company that has seen a lot of volatility. It has meme stock potential and is followed by retail investors. Recent weakness may cause a mean reversion opportunity. Matches 'Meme stock potential, telecom, high retail interest' pattern.; claude_opus: Palantir combines meme stock characteristics (high retail interest like NOK) with AI sector momentum.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_llama: Commodity exposure (lithium), boom/bust cycles, and meme stock potential make it a candidate for mean reversion trading. Recent price weakness is a plus.; ollama_gpt: Tesla shares continue to exhibit extreme volatility and a strong retail\u2011driven support base. After a 2023 correction that left the stock 10% below the 50\u2011day SMA, the price is approaching a key psychological level (e.g., $600). The historical pattern of boom/bust cycles and high short\u2011interest suggests a potential mean\u2011reversion bounce."

      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with extreme volatility tied to BTC price cycles. Exhibits boom/bust patterns similar to WULF and MARA. Recent weakness from 2021 highs presents mean reversion opportunity. Follows crypto mining sector rotation.; xai: CleanSpark (CLSK) is another crypto mining play like WULF and MARA, focusing on sustainable Bitcoin mining with boom/bust sensitivity to crypto prices and energy costs. It shares SOL-USD's extreme volatility and sharp reversals, amplified by retail interest in green mining narratives. Recent weakness stems from broader crypto correction in Q3 2023, but improving hash rates and BTC recovery signal mean reversion potential. Aligns with goldmine commodity/crypto exposure and high volatility; meme-like retail hype could spark rotation from traditional tech."

Sector rotation between growth/value regimes drives predictable sentiment swings suitable for mean reversion.; deepseek: Clean energy/hydrogen stock with boom/bust cycles driven by policy changes and energy transition narratives.

High retail interest and meme stock potential. Weather-driven volatility (hurricane impacts). Sharp reversals from oversold levels.; xai: Transocean (RIG) operates in offshore oil drilling, capturing commodity cycles like EQT with high volatility from oil price swings, geopolitical events, and rig utilization rates. It shares MARA's proxy-like behavior to energy booms/busts and SOL-USD's reversals. Recent weakness from OPEC cuts and rig count declines positions it for mean reversion as drilling activity ramps with $80+ oil. Goldmine ties to commodity exposure and volatility; energy sector rotation amid supply constraints could trigger strong recovery."

Shares WULF's high volatility and SOL-USD's trend reversals, especially in winter heating seasons. Recent weakness from mild weather and high storage levels offers mean reversion setup as demand picks up. Matches goldmine commodity exposure and cycles; sector rotation in energy amid geopolitical tensions boosts confidence for reversals.; claude_opus: Natural gas ETF providing pure commodity exposure like EQT but with contango/backwardation dynamics adding volatility layer. Weather events create sharp spikes that reliably revert. Seasonal patterns well-documented for systematic trading."

      "symbol": "MSTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin proxy and crypto-related stock, MSTR follows crypto cycles and exhibits high volatility, similar to MARA. Recent price weakness due to crypto market downturn could reverse as the market recovers, making it a potential mean reversion candidate.; deepseek: Extreme Bitcoin proxy with higher beta than MARA/RIOT.

Like SOL-USD, it has extreme volatility from regulatory news and market trends.

Like WULF, it has boom/bust exposure to metals prices with sharp reversals. Recent price weakness after copper's summer 2023 dip due to economic slowdown fears sets up mean reversion with tightening supply forecasts. Matches goldmine patterns of commodity volatility and cycles; sector rotation in materials for infrastructure spending enhances reversal odds."
