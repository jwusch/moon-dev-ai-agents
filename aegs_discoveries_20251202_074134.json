      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): openrouter_gemini: Similar to MARA, RIOT is a Bitcoin mining stock and thus a proxy for Bitcoin's price movements. Exhibits high volatility mirroring crypto cycles and is prone to boom/bust scenarios based on Bitcoin's performance. Recent weakness in Bitcoin makes it a potential mean reversion candidate. Matches WULF and MARA patterns.; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a Bitcoin mining stock similar to MARA and WULF, with high volatility tied to crypto cycles and boom/bust patterns driven by Bitcoin price swings. It exhibits extreme volatility and sharp reversals like SOL-USD, often following crypto trends with retail interest amplifying moves.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: GME is a classic meme stock with a history of extreme volatility driven by retail investor sentiment. Although fundamentals are questionable, it remains susceptible to sudden price surges followed by corrections, making it a mean reversion play.
