Aligns with goldmine crypto and volatility patterns; ideal for reversion trading on expected Bitcoin uptrends.; claude_haiku: Crypto mining infrastructure play with similar volatility profile to WULF. Experiences sharp reversals tied to Bitcoin price action and mining difficulty adjustments. Recent weakness creates mean reversion opportunity."
