Sector rotation play (energy).; ollama_gpt: Exxon Mobil is an oil commodity stock with clear sector\u2011rotation opportunities (oil vs. renewable energy). XOM\u2019s recent dip after a rally is tied to a temporary decline in oil demand, and the price is near a 200\u2011day SMA support. The commodity nature of oil and its cyclical price swings make XOM a viable mean\u2011reversion candidate."
