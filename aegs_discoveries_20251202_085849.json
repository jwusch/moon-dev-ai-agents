      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): ollama_llama: Meme stock potential, high volatility, boom/bust cycles. Recent price weakness (-25% in the past month) could indicate a potential reversal as the cybersecurity market stabilizes.; claude_opus: Palantir has strong retail/meme following similar to NOK with high social media sentiment correlation. AI narrative creates boom/bust cycles around earnings and contract announcements. Volatility clusters around news events provide mean reversion entries. Recent pullback from highs offers potential setup."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NIO",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: NIO Inc. is an EV maker that has benefited from retail enthusiasm and sector rotation into technology/green energy.  The stock has been in a 3\u2011month downtrend of ~22\u202f% after a peak in early 2024, yet the EV sector remains in a consolidation phase that frequently triggers mean\u2011reversion opportunities.  The combination of high volatility, sector rotation, and recent weakness makes NIO a strong candidate.; ollama_llama: Sector rotation opportunities, commodity exposure (electric vehicles), high volatility, boom/bust cycles. Recent price weakness (-25% in the past month) could indicate a potential reversal as the electric vehicle market stabilizes."

    {
      "symbol": "HUT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): groq: Hut 8 Mining is a Bitcoin mining stock with crypto exposure and high volatility, similar to MARA and RIOT. Recent price weakness due to crypto market downturn could reverse as crypto trends improve. Matches goldmine patterns: crypto exposure, boom/bust cycles, and high volatility.; xai: Hut 8 Mining is another crypto mining firm with exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, akin to the mining stocks WULF and MARA, featuring high volatility and cyclical booms tied to crypto prices. It has meme-like retail interest during hype cycles. Following a sharp decline in 2023 amid regulatory fears, recent weakness suggests mean reversion potential as institutional crypto inflows could trigger a bounce, aligning with commodity/crypto exposure patterns."

    {
      "symbol": "BTU",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: Coal mining company with commodity cycle exposure and boom/bust patterns. Highly volatile with weather and energy price dependencies similar to EQT. Recent weakness from energy transition concerns creates contrarian plays. Low retail attention.; deepseek: Coal producer with commodity cycle exposure (similar to EQT's energy pattern). Experiences weather/regulation-driven volatility. Currently depressed despite strong coal prices, creating dislocation for mean reversion. Energy transition uncertainty creates boom/bust cycles."

    {
      "symbol": "UVXY",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_llama: The UVXY ETF, which tracks the VIX index, offers a play on volatility itself. Given its inverse relation to market stability, it can exhibit boom/bust cycles and high volatility, similar to the patterns seen in WULF and SOL-USD, making it a potential candidate for mean reversion trading.; claude_opus: VIX-based ETF with built-in mean reversion characteristics due to contango decay. Spikes violently during market stress then reverts predictably. Not a traditional equity but offers pure volatility exposure. Requires different position management but matches boom/bust pattern perfectly."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): groq: As a meme stock with high retail interest, AMC exhibits similar characteristics to NOK. Recent price weakness due to market downturn could reverse as retail interest and sentiment improve. Matches goldmine patterns: meme stock potential, high volatility, and retail interest.; openrouter_gemini: Similar to GME, AMC is another prominent 'meme stock' with a large and active retail investor base. Its stock price is often disconnected from its underlying business performance, making it prone to volatile swings and mean reversion plays. It often moves in tandem with GME, amplifying the meme stock characteristics."
