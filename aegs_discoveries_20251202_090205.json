      "symbol": "FCX",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Copper mining company. Copper prices are volatile and sensitive to economic cycles. FCX\u2019s performance mirrors these cycles.

Weather/geopolitical events drive sharp volatility. Sector rotation between risk-on/risk-off creates predictable cycles. Current weakness vs. macro backdrop suggests mean reversion potential."

The share price has pulled back ~15% in the last 10 days after a sharp rally, hitting a strong support level around $2.50.
