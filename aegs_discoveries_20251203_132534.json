Its price action is similar to WULF, with high volatility and sharp reversals, making it a good candidate for mean reversion trading.; xai: HUT (Hut 8 Mining) operates in crypto mining, akin to WULF and MARA, featuring extreme volatility from Bitcoin cycles and boom/bust phases influenced by energy costs and halving events.
