      "symbol": "SLB",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: Schlumberger provides oilfield services and is heavily exposed to commodity cycles and weather\u2011driven swings. The 20\u2011day SMA is below the 50\u2011day SMA and the 5\u2011day RSI is in oversold territory after a recent pullback, indicating a mean\u2011reversion opportunity. Matches the commodity cycle pattern of EQT.; ollama_llama: Commodity cycles: SLB is an oilfield services company, exposing it to commodity price fluctuations. Sector rotation opportunities: As the energy sector rotates in and out of favor, SLB's stock price can be affected."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Data analytics company with a strong retail following, giving it meme stock characteristics similar to NOK.  Subject to market sentiment shifts regarding growth stocks and tech valuations, resulting in high volatility.  Recent underperformance makes it a candidate for mean reversion.; xai: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) has meme stock potential like NOK, with high retail interest, volatility from AI/data analytics hype, and boom/bust cycles in tech sectors. Strong trends with reversals; recent weakness after 2023 gains faded (down 20%+ YTD 2024 on valuation concerns), positioning for mean reversion if government contracts accelerate. Matches sector rotation in software/tech and indirect crypto exposure via blockchain analytics tools."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "XOM",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: Oil and gas giant, subject to commodity cycles and geopolitical events. Although less volatile than the others, it still experiences price swings based on oil prices. Sector rotation into energy and recent underperformance relative to the broader market make it a reasonable mean reversion candidate.; ollama_gpt: Exxon Mobil is a major oil producer with commodity\u2011cycle driven volatility and weather\u2011driven price swings. Recent low commodity prices and a 20\u2011day SMA below the 50\u2011day SMA create a mean\u2011reversion setup. Matches the \u201cCommodity cycles, weather\u2011driven volatility\u201d pattern of EQT."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "PLUG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): ollama_llama: Cryptocurrency exposure: PLUG provides charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, which is related to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies. Meme stock potential: PLUG has seen significant price swings due to its involvement in the EV supply chain.; claude_opus: Hydrogen/clean energy play with extreme volatility matching WULF's boom/bust profile. Trades on sentiment rather than fundamentals, creating massive overshoots. Green energy sector rotation amplifies moves. After 25%+ drops, historically shows strong 2-3 week recovery patterns."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another classic meme stock with significant retail interest and extreme volatility, mirroring NOK and GME. Subject to boom/bust cycles driven by social media sentiment and short squeeze potential. Sharp price declines offer opportunities for short-term mean reversion trades.; xai: AMC Entertainment (AMC) embodies meme stock potential like NOK, with massive retail-driven volatility, boom/bust cycles from social media hype (e.g., 2021 squeeze), and high short interest leading to sharp reversals. It has recent price weakness, trading down 90%+ from 2021 highs amid theater recovery delays, but could revert mean with improving consumer spending or renewed meme fervor. Limited commodity exposure but fits sector rotation in entertainment/consumer discretionary during risk-on environments."
