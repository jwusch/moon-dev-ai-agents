      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): xai: CleanSpark (CLSK) is another Bitcoin mining company, akin to MARA and WULF, featuring high volatility, boom/bust cycles, and direct crypto exposure. It follows crypto trends with amplified moves due to operational leverage in mining efficiency. Like EQT's commodity cycles, CLSK's performance is tied to energy costs and Bitcoin halvings. Recent weakness from crypto market corrections positions it for mean reversion, as historical patterns show quick recoveries during bull phases with strong retail and institutional interest.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with high retail interest and volatile trading patterns. Follows crypto boom/bust cycles similar to WULF. Weather-dependent (cooling costs) adds commodity-like volatility layer. Recent consolidation suggests potential reversal setup."

Significant drawdowns from peaks.; claude_opus: Offshore drilling contractor with extreme boom/bust cycles tied to oil prices. High operational leverage creates 50%+ swings. Currently in price weakness despite improving offshore drilling demand. Matches commodity cycle pattern with potential sector rotation catalyst."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Tracks the price of natural gas, similar to EQT. Subject to commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility. Short-term price spikes due to weather events or supply disruptions are often followed by mean reversion as conditions normalize.; xai: United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) is an ETF tracking natural gas futures, closely matching EQT's commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and boom/bust patterns influenced by seasonal demand. Like crypto proxies, it has strong trends with reversals during supply gluts or cold snaps. Recent price weakness from mild weather and high inventories in 2024 sets up mean reversion potential, as winter heating demand often triggers rapid rallies in energy sector rotations."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Cryptocurrency exchange, highly correlated with SOL-USD and MARA. Experiences extreme volatility and strong trends with sharp reversals mirroring SOL-USD. As a leading exchange, it's a proxy for overall crypto market sentiment, making it susceptible to boom/bust cycles similar to WULF and MARA. Recent price weakness due to regulatory concerns and market downturn presents a mean reversion opportunity.; xai: Coinbase Global (COIN) serves as a proxy for the broader crypto ecosystem, mirroring SOL-USD's extreme volatility and trend reversals, while also echoing MARA's crypto cycle dependency. As a centralized exchange, it benefits from trading volume booms but suffers in busts. With recent price pullbacks due to regulatory headwinds and market weakness, COIN exhibits meme-like retail interest during hype cycles. This setup supports mean reversion trading, as it often snaps back to highs when crypto sentiment improves and sector rotation favors tech/fintech."

It experiences extreme price swings during crypto rallies and crashes, similar to SOL-USD's sharp reversals.
