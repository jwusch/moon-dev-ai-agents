      "symbol": "RIOT",

      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): ollama_llama: Meme stock potential and recent price weakness: GME has been a popular meme stock, but its price has declined recently. As investors rotate out of this sector, there may be an opportunity for mean reversion.; openrouter_gemini: GameStop (GME) is *the* original meme stock, possessing all the characteristics of 'NOK' but even more pronounced. It is subject to extreme volatility driven by retail trading frenzies and short squeezes. While highly unpredictable, its historical patterns of boom and bust after significant events (like earnings or CEO changes) make it a mean reversion play, albeit a very risky one. Confidence: low"

It exhibits strong trends with reversals like SOL-USD, especially sensitive to energy costs and BTC price movements. After recent weakness from regulatory pressures and energy volatility in 2024, it shows mean reversion opportunity as mining efficiency improvements and crypto ETF inflows could trigger a sharp reversal, aligning with commodity/crypto exposure patterns.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with similar volatility profile to RIOT/MARA.
