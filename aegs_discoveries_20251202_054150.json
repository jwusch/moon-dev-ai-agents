      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (6 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin mining stock, RIOT follows crypto cycles and exhibits high volatility, similar to MARA. Recent price weakness due to crypto market downturn could reverse as the market recovers, making it a good mean reversion candidate.; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a Bitcoin mining company, directly mirroring the crypto mining and high volatility boom/bust cycles of WULF and MARA. It acts as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy with extreme price swings tied to crypto market sentiment. Recent price weakness following the broader crypto downturn in 2022-2023 positions it for mean reversion as Bitcoin stabilizes and mining profitability rebounds with halving cycles. Matches goldmine patterns in crypto exposure and volatility; good mean reversion candidate due to oversold RSI levels and historical sharp reversals post-dips."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another prominent meme stock, similar to 'AMC' and 'NOK'.
