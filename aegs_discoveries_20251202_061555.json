      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with direct crypto cycle exposure. Follows MARA/WULF patterns with extreme volatility during BTC rallies/crashes.

Retail interest in clean energy mining angle adds meme potential.; xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) operates in Bitcoin mining with a focus on sustainable energy, akin to WULF and MARA's high-volatility crypto cycles and boom/bust patterns. It shows extreme price swings like SOL-USD, amplified by news on mining efficiency and halving events. Following recent weakness from Bitcoin's correction and energy cost pressures, it's positioned for mean reversion as crypto sentiment improves, with sector rotation opportunities in green energy-crypto hybrids attracting retail investors.

      "symbol": "UNG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: United States Natural Gas Fund, directly tied to natural gas prices, similar to EQT.

It follows boom/bust cycles like WULF, influenced by software pivots and market sentiment. After recent price weakness amid broader tech sell-offs and delayed EV partnerships, it's a mean reversion candidate as sector rotation favors undervalued tech with IoT potential. Matches goldmine patterns in high retail interest, volatility, and reversal opportunities post-correction.; deepseek: Classic meme stock with cybersecurity/EV narratives, high short interest, frequent retail-driven rallies. Similar to NOK's telecom meme pattern but in tech sector. Recent consolidation near 52-week lows sets up potential reversal."
