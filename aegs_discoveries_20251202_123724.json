      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: United States Natural Gas Fund, an ETF that tracks natural gas prices.  Subject to commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility, similar to EQT.  Sharp price declines due to inventory builds or mild weather could provide mean reversion opportunities. Matches 'EQT' pattern.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices like EQT, with commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and boom/bust patterns influenced by seasonal demand. It has shown recent weakness due to mild weather forecasts suppressing prices, but mean reversion is likely as storage draws or cold snaps reverse the trend. Fits goldmine characteristics in commodity exposure and volatility, offering sector rotation opportunities in energy."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (5 votes): openrouter_gemini: Like GME, AMC is a meme stock with high retail ownership and significant volatility. News events and social media sentiment heavily influence its price. Matches 'NOK' pattern.  Frequent price swings make it attractive for mean reversion.; ollama_gpt: AMC shares exhibit the same meme\u2011stock dynamics as GME, with sharp swings and a recent 18% decline from a recent peak. The retail\u2011driven support and short\u2011squeeze risk make it a strong mean\u2011reversion candidate. It aligns with the meme stock and volatility patterns seen in the goldmines."

Hydrogen narrative drives speculative swings. Currently in depressed state after 80%+ decline from highs - classic mean reversion setup.; deepseek: Hydrogen energy play with meme stock characteristics and 80%+ drawdown from highs. High short interest (25%+) and retail following. Clean energy policy cycles create volatility similar to commodity stocks. Oversold with potential stimulus catalyst."

While fundamentally questionable, its volatility makes it suitable for mean reversion strategies. Matches 'NOK' pattern.  Recent price declines offer a potential entry point.; ollama_gpt: GME is a classic meme stock with extreme volatility and a history of boom/bust cycles. It recently pulled back ~20% from its all\u2011time high, creating a potential mean\u2011reversion window driven by retail support and short\u2011covering pressure.
