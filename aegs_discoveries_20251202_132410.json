Sector rotation opportunities in energy persist. Recent weakness from oil price stabilization below $80/barrel (shares down 10% in late 2024) sets up reversal amid geopolitical tensions.

It shares SOL-USD's trend reversals, amplified by retail interest in green mining narratives. After surging in early 2024, it has shown recent weakness from energy cost pressures and crypto correction, dropping over 40% from highs, setting up for mean reversion as fundamentals like hash rate growth suggest undervaluation.

It exhibits extreme price swings during crypto rallies and crashes, similar to SOL-USD's sharp reversals. Recent price weakness stems from the post-2024 Bitcoin halving dip and broader crypto sell-off, positioning it for mean reversion as mining stocks historically rebound strongly when Bitcoin stabilizes above key supports like $60K. Matches goldmine patterns in crypto cycles and volatility; good mean reversion candidate due to oversold RSI levels below 30 and deviation from 50-day moving average."
