      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with extreme volatility correlated to BTC/ETH cycles. Follows similar patterns to WULF and MARA. Currently undervalued relative to hash rate expansion potential. Strong meme stock following among retail traders.; xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) is another crypto mining play, similar to MARA and WULF, with high volatility driven by Bitcoin cycles and energy costs. It exhibits boom/bust behavior, surging in crypto rallies and crashing in bears. Recent weakness from broader crypto sell-off has pushed it below key support levels, but its low-cost mining efficiency positions it for mean reversion as Bitcoin stabilizes and retail interest returns. Aligns with goldmine crypto exposure and sharp reversals like SOL-USD; good for trading oversold bounces in mining sector rotation."
