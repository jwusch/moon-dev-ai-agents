While fundamentals remain questionable, GME retains significant retail investor interest, exhibiting NOK's meme stock potential. Periodic surges in price are followed by sharp corrections, making it a mean reversion play.; xai: GME (GameStop) embodies meme stock potential like NOK, with extreme retail interest, high volatility, and boom/bust cycles fueled by social media hype. It has experienced sharp reversals post-squeeze events, akin to SOL-USD's trends. Recent weakness from post-2021 fade and e-commerce competition creates mean reversion opportunity as retail sentiment could rotate back during market boredom. Matches goldmine in meme potential, high volatility, and retail-driven cycles; ideal for mean reversion given its history of explosive recoveries from lows.",
