      "symbol": "RIOT",

      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Similar to AMC and NOK, GME is a meme stock with significant retail investor involvement and susceptibility to short squeezes. Its price action is often disconnected from fundamental value, leading to extreme volatility and potential for mean reversion trades. Matches 'Meme stock potential, telecom, high retail interest' pattern.; ollama_gpt: GameStop shares exhibit the same meme\u2011stock dynamics as AMC, with high volatility, retail-driven spikes, and sharp reversals.

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) mirrors WULF and MARA as a crypto mining play with high volatility and boom/bust cycles linked to Bitcoin halvings and energy costs. It shares SOL-USD's sharp reversals during crypto market sentiment shifts and has growing retail interest akin to NOK's meme potential. After recent weakness from operational delays and crypto downturns, it's a strong mean reversion candidate as efficiency improvements and BTC stabilization could trigger a bounce, emphasizing crypto exposure and cyclical recovery.; claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining company with volatile price swings tied to Bitcoin trends. Lower institutional coverage creates meme stock potential. Weather-dependent operations (cooling/energy costs) add commodity-like cycle elements."
