      "symbol": "TSLA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: EV leader with significant sector\u2011rotation exposure and high volatility (matches boom/bust cycle pattern). A 12% fall after an earnings miss and subsequent short covering pressure create a mean\u2011reversion setup.; ollama_llama: Meme stock potential and high retail interest, with recent price weakness due to sector rotation opportunities. TSLA follows a strong trend with sharp reversals, matching SOL-USD's extreme volatility pattern."

      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) is a crypto mining company focused on sustainable Bitcoin operations, matching WULF and MARA's mining stock characteristics with high volatility tied to crypto cycles and energy costs. Like EQT's commodity exposure, it has weather/regulation-driven swings. Recent dips from energy price volatility and crypto winter make it a strong mean reversion candidate as Bitcoin halvings and green energy sector rotation could drive sharp recoveries.; claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with extreme volatility tied to crypto cycles. Follows MARA/WULF patterns with boom/bust characteristics. High retail interest and recent weakness from 2024 highs creates mean reversion opportunity."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: RIG (Transocean) is an offshore drilling company in the oil sector, exhibiting commodity cycles and high volatility akin to EQT's natural gas patterns but with geopolitical and demand-driven booms/busts. It follows energy trends with sharp reversals. After recent weakness from oil price consolidation and OPEC cuts, mean reversion is promising through sector rotation into undervalued energy amid global demand recovery, with some retail interest in commodity plays.; claude_opus: Offshore driller with extreme sensitivity to oil prices and drilling activity cycles. Classic boom/bust energy sector pattern with high debt leverage amplifying moves. When oil sentiment shifts, RIG overshoots dramatically in both directions. Currently in cyclical recovery phase with mean reversion opportunities on pullbacks."

Experiences significant volatility due to weather patterns, supply/demand imbalances, and geopolitical events.  A good candidate for mean reversion trading due to predictable seasonal patterns and overreactions to news.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, directly aligning with EQT's commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility, featuring boom/bust patterns from seasonal demand and supply shocks. High volatility with sharp reversals echoes SOL-USD.
