      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (7 votes): groq: As a Bitcoin mining stock, RIOT is highly correlated with crypto cycles, similar to MARA. It has experienced recent price weakness, making it a potential mean reversion candidate. High volatility and boom/bust cycles in the crypto market also apply to RIOT, increasing its potential for sharp reversals.; openrouter_gemini: Similar to MARA, RIOT is a Bitcoin mining company and thus tightly correlated with Bitcoin's price movements. High volatility, boom/bust cycles, and sensitivity to crypto market sentiment make it a strong candidate for mean reversion strategies, especially after periods of significant price decline."

    {
      "symbol": "GME",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Another classic meme stock, also heavily shorted and prone to volatile swings driven by retail trading activity. Similar to AMC and NOK in its susceptibility to meme-driven rallies and crashes.; xai: GME (GameStop) embodies meme stock potential akin to NOK, driven by high retail interest, social media buzz, and short squeezes in the retail/entertainment sector. It features boom/bust cycles from speculative trading rather than fundamentals, with sector rotation into consumer discretionary during risk-on environments. After recent price weakness post-2021 peak and ongoing volatility, GME is primed for mean reversion if retail sentiment reignites, as seen in past gamma squeezes, directly matching the goldmine pattern of meme-driven high volatility and reversals."
