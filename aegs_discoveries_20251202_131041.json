      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: UNG is a natural gas ETF, directly tied to natural gas prices and influenced by weather patterns, similar to EQT. It experiences high volatility due to supply/demand imbalances and weather-related disruptions. Recent price weakness due to milder weather or increased supply could present a mean reversion opportunity as seasonal demand increases. Matches EQT pattern.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas futures, directly paralleling EQT's commodity cycles, weather-driven volatility, and high boom/bust swings from seasonal demand. It offers pure exposure without company-specific risks, with sharp reversals like SOL-USD during supply disruptions. Following mild winter weakness in early 2024 leading to storage builds, it is primed for mean reversion as summer cooling or geopolitical events drive sector rotation into energy commodities."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) operates in Bitcoin mining with a focus on sustainable energy, akin to the high volatility and boom/bust cycles in WULF and MARA. It exhibits strong trends with sharp reversals tied to crypto market sentiment, much like SOL-USD, and benefits from commodity exposure via electricity costs. Recent weakness stems from post-halving profit squeezes and broader crypto sell-offs, but improving hash rates and efficiency suggest mean reversion potential as crypto rebounds and sector rotation favors green energy miners.; claude_haiku: Crypto mining company with similar volatility profile to RIOT/MARA. Institutional adoption narrative creates sharp reversals. Weather-dependent operations (cooling costs) add commodity-like cyclicality. Recent selloffs from highs."
