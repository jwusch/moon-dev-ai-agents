    {
      "symbol": "TSLA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: Tesla \u2013 a high\u2011volatility growth stock that exhibits boom/bust cycles similar to AEGS. After a recent sharp decline from its peak, TSLA presents a clear mean\u2011reversion opportunity.; ollama_llama: Commodity exposure (electric vehicles), high volatility, boom/bust cycles, and meme stock potential. Recent price weakness could be a buying opportunity due to sector rotation and mean reversion."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "LCID",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: EV stock with meme potential and extreme retail interest. Exhibits sharp trend reversals and high volatility. Sector rotation sensitivity (EV boom/bust). Recent weakness from highs with strong recovery potential.; ollama_llama: Commodity exposure (electric vehicles), high volatility, boom/bust cycles, and meme stock potential. Recent price weakness could be a buying opportunity due to sector rotation and mean reversion."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "PLTR",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Data analytics company with meme stock characteristics. Cathie Wood favorite. High retail interest and prone to sentiment-driven swings. Experiences periods of high growth and subsequent pullbacks, creating mean reversion setups. Matches NOK pattern and potentially WULF due to growth stock cycles.; claude_haiku: High retail interest with meme stock characteristics. Exhibits volatility with sharp reversals. Sector rotation exposure (defense tech, AI, crypto analytics). Recent weakness from highs with strong reversal potential."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "NVDA",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: NVIDIA \u2013 a leading AI chipmaker that benefits from sector\u2011rotation dynamics. Its price has recently corrected after a rapid rally, offering a mean\u2011reversion trade in a high\u2011volatility tech sector.; claude_haiku: AI/crypto semiconductor play with dual exposure. High volatility with sector rotation cycles. AI mining and crypto infrastructure demand creates boom/bust potential. Strong retail following and recent pullbacks."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "XOM",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_gemini: Major oil company. Exposure to energy commodity cycles, sensitive to geopolitical events and supply/demand dynamics. While less volatile than crypto, it experiences significant price swings. Sector rotation candidate as energy falls in and out of favor. Matches EQT pattern.; ollama_gpt: Exxon Mobil \u2013 an oil\u2011commodity stock that experiences price cycles tied to global supply/demand and weather events. XOM\u2019s recent pullback after a rally aligns with the commodity\u2011cycle pattern for mean reversion."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "BTU",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_llama: BTU is a coal mining stock with commodity exposure, which can lead to boom/bust cycles and weather-driven volatility, similar to EQT. Recent price weakness could be a buying opportunity for a potential reversal.; deepseek: Coal producer with commodity cycle exposure (similar to EQT's energy volatility). Trading at cyclical lows despite strong fundamentals, creating disconnect between price and cash flow. Weather patterns and energy policy shifts could trigger rapid re-rating. High dividend yield provides downside cushion."
    },
    {
      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): openrouter_gemini: Classic meme stock. Extremely high retail interest and susceptible to short squeezes. Fundamental weakness makes it prone to sharp declines followed by potential bounces. Matches NOK pattern strongly.; ollama_gpt: AMC Entertainment \u2013 another meme\u2011stock driven by retail hype. After a steep decline from its recent highs, AMC shows a typical boom/bust cycle that often reverts to a mean."
