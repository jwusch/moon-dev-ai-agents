Recent weakness presents mean reversion setup.; xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) mirrors WULF and MARA as a crypto mining play with extreme volatility from Bitcoin dependency, featuring boom/bust cycles and weather-independent energy efficiency angles for sector rotation.

Recent price weakness from mild weather forecasts in fall 2024 has pushed it to multi-month lows, setting up mean reversion if winter demand surges or geopolitical events tighten supply, matching commodity exposure and volatility characteristics.; claude_opus: Natural gas ETF providing pure commodity exposure matching EQT weather-driven volatility pattern. Contango/backwardation creates additional mean reversion opportunities beyond spot price. Seasonal patterns are highly predictable - winter spikes and summer weakness.
