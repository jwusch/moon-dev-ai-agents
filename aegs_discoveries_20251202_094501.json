After a recent 15\u2011plus\u2011percent decline from a peak, a mean\u2011reversion trade is plausible.

After a recent 12\u2011plus\u2011percent drop from a high, the stock is likely to revert as demand cycles normalize. Matches *commodity* and *sector\u2011rotation* patterns.; xai: Schlumberger (SLB) in oilfield services shows commodity exposure with high volatility from energy cycles, similar to EQT's weather-driven natural gas busts/ booms. Sector rotation into energy during inflation hedges amplifies trends with sharp reversals.

It exhibits extreme trends and sharp reversals similar to SOL-USD, amplified by energy costs and regulatory news.

Down ~45% from 2024 highs due to efficiency challenges, it offers mean reversion via sector rotation into cost-efficient miners during crypto upswings, bolstered by growing retail interest for meme potential.; deepseek: Small-cap Bitcoin miner with extreme volatility (similar to WULF pattern). Higher operational leverage than larger miners creates amplified boom/bust cycles. Currently trading below production cost estimates after Bitcoin halving concerns.

It has strong exposure to cryptocurrency cycles, with price action driven by Bitcoin trends and halvings.
