Recent weakness from post-pandemic recovery slowdown and debt concerns positions it for mean reversion, as meme stocks like this historically rebound 50-200% on social media buzz. Matches goldmine patterns in meme potential, volatility, and sector rotation from media to undervalued consumer plays; oversold conditions and high short interest signal reversal opportunity."
