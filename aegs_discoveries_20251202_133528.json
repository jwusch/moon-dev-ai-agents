      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with direct crypto cycle exposure. Exhibits boom/bust patterns identical to MARA and WULF. High retail attention as crypto infrastructure play. Extreme volatility creates mean reversion opportunities during sector pullbacks.; deepseek: Bitcoin miner with higher volatility than larger peers.

    {
      "symbol": "RIG",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_gpt: Crypto\u2011mining firm that follows Bitcoin\u2019s cycle. RIG\u2019s share price has surged during bull markets and collapsed during bear phases, creating pronounced boom/bust swings. It has been in a price trough since early 2024, and its high volatility makes it a prime mean\u2011reversion candidate.; claude_opus: Transocean operates in offshore drilling with extreme oil cycle sensitivity. Boom/bust pattern mirrors commodity goldmines with added leverage due to high debt load. Stock tends to overshoot fair value in both directions based on oil sentiment. Recent sector rotation away from energy creates potential mean reversion setup."

Subject to weather-driven volatility and commodity cycles. Sharp price declines due to unexpected weather patterns or inventory builds can create mean reversion opportunities.; xai: UNG (United States Natural Gas Fund ETF) tracks natural gas prices, aligning with EQT's commodity cycles and weather-driven volatility. It shows high volatility with boom/bust patterns from supply disruptions and seasonal demand, including sharp reversals on inventory reports. Recent price weakness in summer 2024 (low storage draws) suggests mean reversion potential heading into winter heating season, with sector rotation from renewables back to fossils. Matches goldmine commodity exposure for cyclical reversion trades on oversold dips."

Cybersecurity pivot narrative creates periodic retail interest surges. Low price point attracts options activity and gamma squeezes.
