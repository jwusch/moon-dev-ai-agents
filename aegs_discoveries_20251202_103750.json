      "symbol": "BITF",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Canadian Bitcoin miner with commodity-like cycle behavior. Experiences sharp reversals on BTC sentiment shifts. Lower valuation multiples than peers suggest reversion potential. Weather/energy cost volatility adds dimension.; ollama_gpt: Bitcoin Fund ETF that provides direct crypto exposure while trading on a traditional exchange. The fund is extremely volatile and has recently retraced from a rally, trading below its 50\u2011day SMA. This fits the crypto exposure and boom/bust cycle patterns, making it a good mean\u2011reversion candidate."

Recent price weakness could indicate a reversal opportunity.; ollama_gpt: Electric\u2011vehicle maker with strong retail sentiment and meme\u2011stock characteristics. NIO\u2019s price has pulled back after a rally, now trading near its 20\u2011day SMA, indicating a potential mean\u2011reversion.

      "symbol": "AMC",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): xai: AMC (AMC Entertainment) embodies meme stock potential with high retail interest and volatility, much like NOK's telecom meme surges. It experiences boom/bust cycles driven by social media hype and short squeezes, with sector rotation in entertainment/consumer discretionary. Recent weakness from post-pandemic recovery slowdowns and debt concerns has pushed it to multi-year lows, but past sharp reversals (e.g., 2021 squeeze) make it a prime mean reversion candidate, potentially reversing on renewed meme fervor.; ollama_gpt: Another high\u2011profile meme stock that has experienced extreme volatility and a recent pullback after the short\u2011squeeze. Its price is currently below the 50\u2011day SMA, creating a classic mean\u2011reversion scenario. It also benefits from sector rotation as investors move into or out of retail\u2011driven plays."

      "symbol": "BB",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): xai: BB (BlackBerry) has meme stock potential from its tech turnaround narrative and retail interest, akin to NOK's telecom volatility. It features high volatility with boom/bust cycles in cybersecurity/software, plus sector rotation in tech. Recent price weakness from delayed profitability and market rotations out of small caps in 2024 sets up mean reversion, as past hype-driven spikes (e.g., 2021-2022) show potential for reversals on positive earnings or partnerships.; deepseek: Former meme stock with cybersecurity/auto software exposure. Maintains retail investor base and shows sharp reversals. Currently depressed after IoT hype cycle, but patent portfolio and QNX automotive software provide underlying value for mean reversion."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_llama: Meme stock potential with strong retail interest, which can create boom/bust cycles. Recent price weakness might signal a reversal.; deepseek: Tech stock with meme characteristics and boom/bust cycles. Heavy institutional ownership creates volatility during earnings. Recent weakness after AI hype cycle decline presents mean reversion opportunity as government contracts provide baseline value."

      "symbol": "CLSK",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): claude_haiku: Cryptocurrency mining with similar volatility profile to WULF. Follows BTC cycles closely with exaggerated moves. Recent weakness from macro headwinds creates mean reversion setup. Strong retail following.; xai: CLSK (CleanSpark) is another crypto mining company focused on Bitcoin, exhibiting the same high volatility and cycle-driven behavior as MARA and WULF. It benefits from commodity-like exposure to Bitcoin's price fluctuations and has shown boom/bust patterns with retail interest spikes. Following recent weakness due to mining profitability pressures and crypto winter, its history of rapid recoveries post-dips (e.g., 2021-2022 cycles) positions it well for mean reversion trading, akin to EQT's weather/commodity volatility but in crypto."

      "symbol": "SOUN",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_opus: SoundHound AI has strong meme stock characteristics similar to NOK - high retail interest, AI narrative driving speculation, and prone to sharp sentiment-driven swings. Recent weakness after AI hype cycle creates potential reversion setup. Exhibits boom/bust pattern around earnings and AI news.; deepseek: AI audio technology stock with meme characteristics and extreme volatility. Similar to crypto stocks in hype cycle patterns. Currently down 80%+ from highs despite AI tailwinds. Small float and high short interest create squeeze potential."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): claude_haiku: Freeport-McMoRan copper/gold miner with commodity cycle exposure and weather/supply chain volatility. Institutional quality but still exhibits boom/bust patterns. Sector rotation with energy/materials cycles.; xai: FCX (Freeport-McMoRan) is a copper mining stock with strong commodity cycles, high volatility from global demand (e.g., China/EV), and boom/bust patterns similar to EQT. It ties into sector rotation in metals/industrials and has indirect crypto exposure via mining tech overlaps. After recent pullbacks due to economic slowdown fears in 2024, its history of sharp reversals on infrastructure/green energy news makes it a solid mean reversion play, echoing WULF's mining volatility."

It has meme stock potential from retail trader enthusiasm and sector rotation into fintech/crypto. After recent price pullbacks amid regulatory headwinds and market corrections in 2024, its mean reversion appeal lies in historical bounces during crypto rallies, offering high-reward setups similar to the boom/bust of WULF.; claude_opus: Coinbase is crypto-adjacent like SOL exposure but as equity. Extreme volatility tied to crypto market sentiment, regulatory news creates sharp reversals, and institutional crypto proxy status means amplified moves during Bitcoin cycles. Higher liquidity than miners but similar directional beta."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (4 votes): claude_haiku: Bitcoin mining stock with direct crypto cycle exposure. Exhibits extreme volatility mirroring MARA and WULF patterns. High retail interest during bull runs, sharp reversals during bear markets. Currently undervalued relative to BTC price support levels.; xai: RIOT (Riot Platforms) is a Bitcoin mining stock, directly mirroring the crypto mining and high volatility boom/bust cycles of WULF and MARA. It acts as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy with extreme price swings tied to crypto market sentiment. Recent price weakness stems from the broader crypto downturn in 2023-2024, but historical patterns show sharp reversals during bull cycles, making it ideal for mean reversion as it often bounces back strongly after oversold conditions, similar to SOL-USD's trends with reversals."
