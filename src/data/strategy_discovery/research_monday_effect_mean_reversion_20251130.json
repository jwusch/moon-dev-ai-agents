    "market_regime_analysis": "Market Regime Analysis: Monday Effect Mean Reversion Strategy\n\n1. Bull Markets (Strong Uptrend)\nPerformance Rating: 2/5\nRationale: During strong bull markets, momentum tends to override mean reversion patterns. Weekend gaps are more likely to continue the upward trend, reducing the effectiveness of the strategy. Stocks may have less pronounced pullbacks on Monday opens.\n\nModification: Increase filter criteria, look for more significant divergence from recent trend.\n\n2. Bear Markets (Strong Downtrend)\nPerformance Rating: 4/5\nRationale: Bear markets often create more pronounced weekend gaps and emotional selling. Monday opens can show more extreme price movements, creating better mean reversion opportunities. Panic selling over weekends can create exaggerated opening moves.\n\nModification: Implement tighter stop-loss and take-profit levels.\n\n3. Sideways/Ranging Markets\nPerformance Rating: 5/5\nRationale: Ideal environment for mean reversion strategies. Limited directional momentum allows for more predictable weekend gap reversals. Price oscillations are more consistent and less influenced by strong trends.\n\nModification: Optimize position sizing and use range-based entry/exit criteria.\n\n4. High Volatility Periods\nPerformance Rating: 3/5\nRationale: Mixed performance. While high volatility can create more gap opportunities, it also increases unpredictability. Larger price swings can make precise mean reversion more challenging.\n\nModification: Use wider stop-losses, reduce position size, implement volatility-based position scaling.\n\n5. Low Volatility Periods\nPerformance Rating: 2/5\nRationale: Limited price movement reduces gap potential. Weekend gaps are smaller and less pronounced, limiting mean reversion opportunities.\n\nModification: Combine with additional momentum or volume indicators to filter trades.\n\n6. Market Cap Environments:\n- Large Cap: Performance Rating 3/5\n  - More stable, but less dramatic gap movements\n  - Better information efficiency\n  - Lower volatility\n\n- Small Cap: Performance Rating 4/5\n  - More pronounced weekend gaps\n  - Higher emotional trading\n  - Less efficient price discovery\n\nAdditional Strategic Recommendations:\n1. Use multi-timeframe analysis\n2. Incorporate volume confirmation\n3. Implement adaptive position sizing\n4. Consider sector-specific variations\n5. Use machine learning to refine entry/exit criteria\n\nKey Performance Indicators to Monitor:\n- Weekend gap size\n- Previous week's market sentiment\n- Relative volume\n- Sector-specific momentum\n\nRisk Management:\n- Maximum 1-2% portfolio risk per trade\n- Use tight stop-losses\n- Diversify across multiple stocks/sectors\n- Regularly backtest and adjust strategy parameters\n\nOptimal Market Conditions Summary:\nBest: Sideways markets, bear markets, small-cap environments\nWorst: Strong bull markets, low volatility periods\n\nConclusion: The Monday Effect Mean Reversion strategy requires careful adaptation to current market conditions, with a focus on dynamic risk management and precise entry/exit criteria."
