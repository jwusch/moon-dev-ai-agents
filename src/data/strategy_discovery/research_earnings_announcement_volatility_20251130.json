Most sensitive parameters: ATR multiplier, implied volatility range\n2. Recommended initial optimization focus: Entry criteria and stop loss parameters\n3. Risk management is critical - keep per-trade risk below 1%\n4. Adapt parameters dynamically based on market regime\n\nRecommended Optimization Approach:\n- Use walk-forward analysis\n- Implement Monte Carlo simulation\n- Cross-validate across different market conditions\n- Regularly re-optimize (quarterly/semi-annually)\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the optimization framework?",
    "market_regime_analysis": "Market Regime Analysis: Earnings Announcement Volatility Strategy\n\n1. Bull Markets (Strong Uptrend)\nPerformance Rating: 3/5\nRationale: \n- Positive market sentiment can compress volatility expectations\n- Companies may have more positive earnings surprises\n- Implied vol might be lower, reducing strategy edge\nModifications: Focus on sectors with stronger growth potential\n\n2.
