    "market_regime_analysis": "Market Regime Analysis for RSI-2 Mean Reversion Strategy\n\n1. Bull Markets (Strong Uptrend)\nPerformance Rating: 2/5\nRationale: Mean reversion strategies typically struggle in strong trending markets. The strategy's short-term pullback approach will face headwinds as stocks quickly resume upward momentum. Frequent false signals and potential missed opportunities in strong upward moves.\nModification: Adjust RSI thresholds (e.g., use lower RSI entry point of 5) or add trend confirmation filter.\n\n2. Bear Markets (Strong Downtrend)\nPerformance Rating: 4/5\nRationale: Mean reversion strategies can excel in downtrending markets. Sharp oversold bounces create ideal conditions for short-term mean reversion trades. Volume filter helps confirm potential reversal points.\nModification: Consider adding a volatility filter to capture most significant bounce opportunities.\n\n3. Sideways/Ranging Markets\nPerformance Rating: 5/5\nRationale: Ideal market condition for this strategy. Consistent price oscillations between support and resistance create perfect mean reversion opportunities. Volume filter adds additional confirmation.\nModification: Potentially tighten exit criteria to maximize range-bound profits.\n\n4. High Volatility Periods\nPerformance Rating: 3/5\nRationale: Mixed performance. Increased price swings can create more mean reversion opportunities but also increase false signals and potential whipsaws.\nModification: Widen RSI thresholds, increase volume filter multiplier to reduce noise.\n\n5. Low Volatility Periods\nPerformance Rating: 2/5\nRationale: Limited price movement reduces mean reversion opportunities. Strategy may struggle to find meaningful entry points.\nModification: Combine with additional momentum or trend indicators to identify subtle opportunities.\n\n6. Market Cap Environments:\n- Large Cap Stocks: 4/5 \n  - More stable, predictable mean reversion\n  - More consistent volume patterns\n  - Lower volatility supports strategy\n\n- Small Cap Stocks: 3/5\n  - More volatile, potential for larger moves\n  - Less predictable volume patterns\n  - Higher risk but potentially higher reward\n\nOverall Strategy Optimization Recommendations:\n1. Adaptive RSI thresholds based on market regime\n2. Multi-timeframe volume confirmation\n3. Incorporate volatility-adjusted position sizing\n4. Add trend filter to reduce false signals in strong trending markets\n\nKey Insights:\n- Best in ranging and bear markets\n- Requires careful adaptation to different market conditions\n- Volume filter critical for confirmation\n- Performance varies significantly across market regimes\n\nPotential Advanced Modifications:\n- Dynamic RSI thresholds (10-20 range instead of fixed 10)\n- Sector-specific calibration\n- Volatility-adjusted entry/exit criteria\n\nRecommended Primary Use: Sideways and bear market conditions with large-cap stocks."
