      "symbol": "HUT",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): openrouter_llama: As a miner with exposure to crypto cycles, Hut 8 Mining Corp. follows patterns similar to WULF and MARA. High volatility and recent price drops could reverse with a rebound in crypto prices or mining profitability.; xai: Hut 8 Mining (HUT) is a crypto mining firm akin to WULF and MARA, with high volatility tied to Bitcoin cycles and commodity-like exposure to energy costs for mining. It follows boom/bust patterns with sharp reversals during crypto winters. After underperforming in 2024 due to efficiency upgrades and market dips, HUT's recent weakness could revert mean as Ethereum staking and BTC rallies provide tailwinds, enhancing its crypto proxy status."
