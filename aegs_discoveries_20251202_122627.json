      "symbol": "SLV",
      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (2 votes): ollama_llama: Commodity exposure through silver mining, high volatility and boom/bust cycles due to precious metal trends, and recent price weakness could reverse due to inflation concerns.; xai: SLV (iShares Silver Trust ETF) provides commodity exposure similar to EQT's natural gas, with high volatility from industrial demand, inflation hedges, and mining supply cycles, leading to boom/bust patterns. It has rotation opportunities in precious metals during economic uncertainty. Recent price weakness in 2024 from stronger USD makes it ripe for mean reversion if rate cuts materialize. Aligns with goldmine patterns of commodity cycles and volatility; viable for reversion as silver often mean-reverts after deviations, with historical sharp recoveries on macro shifts."

High risk, but also high potential for mean reversion bounces after significant declines.; xai: AMC (AMC Entertainment) parallels NOK's telecom/meme hybrid with high retail interest in entertainment sector, featuring extreme volatility and boom/bust from crowd-sourced trading. It has commodity-like exposure via debt cycles and box office trends. Recent weakness stems from post-pandemic recovery stalls in 2024, but dilution fears easing could trigger reversal. Fits goldmine patterns of meme potential and high volatility; mean reversion opportunity from oversold levels, as it has repeatedly bounced on sentiment shifts and sector rotations into value plays."

      "reason": "Swarm Consensus (3 votes): openrouter_gemini: Cryptocurrency exchange, directly exposed to crypto volatility. Matches 'WULF' and 'SOL-USD' patterns. High beta and prone to sharp corrections followed by rallies. Recent weakness due to regulatory concerns and crypto market downturn makes it a potential mean reversion play.; xai: COIN (Coinbase Global) acts as a Bitcoin proxy like MARA, with crypto exchange exposure leading to high volatility, strong trends, and sharp reversals akin to SOL-USD. It benefits from sector rotations into fintech/crypto during bull markets. Following a dip in trading volumes and stock price in Q3 2024, recent weakness suggests mean reversion potential as regulatory tailwinds emerge. Matches goldmine patterns of crypto cycles and boom/bust; excellent for reversion trading due to its correlation with BTC and history of quick recoveries post-drawdowns."
