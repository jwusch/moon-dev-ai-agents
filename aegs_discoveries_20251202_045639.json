It has shown boom/bust patterns, surging during crypto bull runs and crashing in bears. Recent weakness follows a post-halving dip and energy cost pressures, positioning it for mean reversion if crypto sentiment improves, as mining stocks historically overshoot to the downside before snapping back.
